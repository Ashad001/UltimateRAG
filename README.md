# AI-Based Application with Svelte Frontend

This project is an AI-based application that leverages Gemini/OpenAI and JinaAI embeddings on a FastAPI backend. The application is capable of reading PDFs, maintaining webpage memory, and facilitating interactive chat with websites, webpages, and PDFs.

## Project Description

The AI-based application aims to provide an interactive and intelligent interface for users to engage with various digital content. The key features of the application include:

- **PDF Reading**: The application can read and understand the content of PDF documents.
- **Webpage Memory**: The application retains memory of interactions on webpages, allowing for a seamless user experience.
- **Interactive Chat**: Users can chat with the application about websites, webpages, and PDFs, receiving intelligent and context-aware responses.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: the backend and the frontend.
